# üîç Intelligent Customer Segmentation from Telecom Call History Using Microsoft Fabric
A scalable customer segmentation pipeline using real-world telecom call history data ‚Äî all developed, deployed, and visualized end-to-end in Microsoft Fabric.
Leverage the power of data to unlock hidden customer insights and drive revenue with intelligent segmentation.

## üöÄ Project Summary

This project uses machine learning and Microsoft Fabric's end-to-end data platform to segment telecom customers based on detailed call history behavior. By analyzing usage trends, recharge patterns, and behavioral KPIs, we identify high-impact segments like **Spend-Driven Data User**, **Call Heavy User**,**Peak-Time Receiver**, **Unbilled Texter** and **Subscription Heavy**. This empowers marketing teams to personalize engagement and optimize revenue strategies.

## üéØ Business Goals

- Identify and group customers by real usage behavior.
- Discover patterns in recharge frequency, voice/data usage, and revenue.
- Drive marketing strategies through actionable customer insights.
- Enable retention campaigns through data-driven segmentation.

## üß™ ML Workflow Summary

**Training Pipeline**
- Ingest raw data via On-Prem Gateway ‚Üí Data Factory ‚Üí Lakehouse
- Preprocess and engineer features in Fabric Notebook
- Standardize data & reduce dimensions via PCA
- Auto-select optimal number of clusters (k) using Elbow Method
- Apply KMeans clustering with dynamic k
- Extract top 3 features per cluster to label segments (e.g., *High Spender*)

**Inference Pipeline**
- Reuse saved scaler, PCA, and model for new data
- Predict cluster, map to segment labels
- Store output as Delta Table for Power BI
